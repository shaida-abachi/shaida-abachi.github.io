			<h1>Hi, I'm Shaida Abachi!</h1> <b>shay-duh (she/her)</b>
		
			<p>I’m a Cognitive Sciences PhD student working with Dr. Megan Peters at the University of California, Irvine. 
				My current work seeks to investigate the neural computations underlying perceptual metacognition in humans using fMRI.
				My current interests surround visual perception and metacognition—ultimately to better 
				understand how they work so we can know why they break (i.e., disorders of cognition). I have also always been 
				motivated to study human behavior, specifically how we make decisions.<br><br>
				
				I recieved my B.S. in Neuroscience from The Univeristy of California, Riverside. Throughout undergrad, I worked under 
				Dr. Monica Carson and looked at how microglial mechanisms that detect neuronal injury might change throughout early development in mice.
				Although that work was quite different from my current graduate work, I believe I've gotten a better idea of studying the brain from
				both top-down or bottom-up approaches. There is no single right way to study the brain—there are many
				ways to tackle the same questions.<br><br>

				Overall, I have a passion for brains, behavior, and data.<br><br>
				
				When I’m not confusing the comment keys when switching between MATLAB and Python in the same day, I’m probably drinking boba with my lab mates, playing video games, or hanging out with my pup. </p>
