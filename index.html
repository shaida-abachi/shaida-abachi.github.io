			<h1>Hi, I'm Shaida Abachi!</h1> <b>shay-duh (she/her)</b>
		
			<p>I am currently a contract User Experience Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs. In my role, I 
				design and conduct qualitative and quantitative research. The areas of study surrounding my research programs are
				visual perception relating to optical components of virtual and augmented reality devices.
				<br><br>
				I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, where I studied
				the neural computations underlying perceptual metacognition in humans using fMRI.
				My current interests surround visual perception and metacognition—ultimately to better 
				understand how they work so we can know why they break (i.e., disorders of cognition).<br><br>

				Overall, I have a passion for understanding brains, behavior, and data.<br><br>
				
				When I'm not conducting research, I’m probably playing video games :) </p>
