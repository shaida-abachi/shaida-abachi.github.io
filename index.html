			<h1>Hi, I'm Shaida Abachi! <small><small>shay-duh (she/her)</small></small></h1>

			<p>I’m a Cognitive Sciences PhD student at the University of California, Irvine. My current work seeks to investigate the neural computations of perceptual metacognition in humans using fMRI.
				My interests surround visual perception and metacognition—ultimately to better understand how they work so we can know why they break (i.e., disorders of cognition).<br><br>
				I recieved my B.S. in Neuroscience from The Univeristy of California, Riverside. Throughout undergrad, I worked under Dr. Monica Carson and looked at how microglial mechanisms that detect neuronal injury might change throughout early development in mice.<br><br>
				When I’m not confusing the comment keys when switching between MATLAB and Python, I’m probably playing video games or walking my dog Pluto. </p>
